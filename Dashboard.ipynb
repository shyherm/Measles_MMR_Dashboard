    "When comparing measles cases across the current available years (2023-2025), age groups 01-04 and 05-10 make up the largest portion of average measles cases per month. When analyzing specific months, in September 2025 the 01-04 age group had an increase in average measles cases, as did the 15-24 age group in October of the same year. In October 2024, the 05-10 age group had an increase in average measles cases, whereas the 35+ age group saw a decrease in average measles cases for the same month. The data is limited for 2023. The only specified age group for September 2023 was the 15-24 age group. This is possibly due to gaps in data reporting."

This figure compares MMR1 and MMR2 vaccination coverage percentages across several years of available data. A date range slider is displayed at the top of the figure.

In 2010, MMR1 and MMR2 both had low coverage percentages, where for MMR1 it was 91.01% and for MMR2 it was 82.69%. Overall, the percentage of eligible children who receive the first dose of MMR is higher than the percentage of eligible children who receive the second dose.

    "The MMR vaccination metrics tracked in Figure 2 look at eligible children receiving the first and second doses of the MMR vaccine by the ages of 2 and 5. Specifically looking at the years the measles case data is collected for, in Figure 2, from 2023-2025 there is a general upward trend for MMR1 coverage percentages and a downward trend for MMR2 coverage percentages. The two age groups from Figure 1 that consistently made up the largest portion of average measles cases per month were ages 01-04 and 05-10. The downward trend of the MMR2 coverage percentages could signify that children are not receiving the second MMR dose by the age of 5 which is required to reach full protection against measles. Subsequently, these age groups would have higher measles susceptibility which would attribute to the higher average monthly measles case data seen in Figure 1. "
